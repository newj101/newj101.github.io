<h3>A comparison of methods for estimating vertical wind from dropsondes</h3>

<p>Measuring vertical wind using dropsondes is useful for studying the dynamics and thermodynamics of tropical cyclones. Vertical wind can be estimated from dropsondes by finding the difference between the dropsonde’s measured fall rate and terminal velocity. Determining an accurate dropsonde terminal velocity is challenging since it requires either experimentation in ideal conditions, which are not reflective of tropical cyclones, or an analysis of dropsonde observations within an environment of potentiality strong convective motions. Two methods for finding the dropsonde terminal velocity and resulting vertical wind were examined. The first method determines a theoretical terminal velocity based on the dropsonde design, parachute size, and a drag coefficient. The second method estimates the dropsonde terminal velocity by finding the median fall rate of a large sample of dropsondes with similar designs. The fall rates and vertical winds were calculated from dropsondes released by NOAA and NASA aircraft from 2010–2024 using four different dropsonde models. For three of the dropsonde models, the median fall rates were faster than the corresponding theoretical terminal velocity. This difference resulted in the vertical wind estimated using the theoretical terminal velocity having a larger percentage of downward motion than upward motion. In contrast, the vertical wind estimated using the median fall rates had a more symmetric distribution of upward and downward motions. Overall, estimating vertical wind from dropsondes using the median fall rate for the corresponding dropsonde model is recommended versus using the theoretical terminal velocity.</p>
